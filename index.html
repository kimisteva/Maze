                <p>Before you is a maze, and your job is to get to the end and of it and eat the grandma.<br>
                You can use W A S D to move or the arrowkeys up down left right. If you get to the glasses<br> 
                you can see the solution to the maze. But watch out because there is a timer of 120 seconds.<br>
                GOOD LUCK!
